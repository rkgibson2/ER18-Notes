We are talking aboiut another Daoist text, The Inward Training.
However, the label for Daoism was only invented later, so at the time, he didn't think he was similar to Laozi.

The Inward Training tries to be surprising.
It focuses on trying to improve yourself.
For instance, one thing it talks about is qi, which it defines as "vital energy."
All things have qi, of different levels of refinement (heaven vs. mud).
Things on earth have low level, unrefined qi, while those in heaven have highly refined qi.
Spirits in heaven have what is called luminosity (also translatable as divine, spiritual).
They can change the world around them, interact with things.

Because humans are between heaven and earth, we have a lot of turbid qi.
We have a limited amount of luminosity, so we can interact a little bit witht he world and change it a little bit.

According to The Inward Training, each day, we get more tired and more tired, and when we are tired, we are cranky and annoyed.
This is because we are losing our qi, losing our luminosity, losing our essence.
Over your life, you lose your qi and lose excitement with the world.
This is why you get sicker easier and eventually die.

On the other hand, when you are more engaged with the world, more excited, you feel more alive.
If you feel that same level of excitement every day, you will never lose your qi.

Spirits see things flawlessly.
They don't fall into the same problems we do.
They can affect the world through their intense vital energy, qi, charisma.
They affect things by their very presence.
