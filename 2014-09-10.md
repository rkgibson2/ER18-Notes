ER 18 Notes

### September 10, 2014

In the middle of the first millenium B.C.E., almost all the great philosophical traditions started.
Socrates, Plato, The Buddha, Conficius, etc.

Furthermore, all these new religions/philosophies believe in some better world beyond that all people can access.

Also during this time, lots of political and social change:
* New ideas of statecraft
* Highly militarized societies with constant warfare (Greek city-states, Chinese Warring States Period)

These new religious movements are dissatisfied with the way their society is currently working, so they call for change.

In the nineteenth century, many Western historians were surprised to discover that all these things emerged at the same time.
One of them proposed calling this time the "Axial Age" because it was an axis of world history.
People started looking up and thinking about more "philosophical things"
