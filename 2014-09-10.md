ER 18 Notes

### September 10, 2014

In the middle of the first millenium B.C.E., almost all the great philosophical traditions started.
Socrates, Plato, The Buddha, Conficius, etc.

Furthermore, all these new religions/philosophies believe in some better world beyond that all people can access.

Also during this time, lots of political and social change:
* New ideas of statecraft
* Highly militarized societies with constant warfare (Greek city-states, Chinese Warring States Period)

These new religious movements are dissatisfied with the way their society is currently working, so they call for change.

In the nineteenth century, many Western historians were surprised to discover that all these things emerged at the same time.
Karl Jaspers calling this time the [Axial Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_Age) because it was an axis or pivot of world history.
People started looking up and thinking about more "philosophical things," a huge turning point in human history.

However, his model was mostly focused on the Western philosophers, especially Socrates.
When you look at Southeast Asian and Chinese philosophers from this time, they say different things.

Many Chinese philosophers say that we should change our current world to get better, not follow some god or hope for a better afterlife.
They are focused on self-improvment in this life.

I (Michael Puett) believe that these philosphers are important today because we are living in a similar period now!
In the Bronze Age, societies were very hereditary and very militaristic.
THen, these philosophers emerged, but after that, Western Europe returned to society like the Bronze Age.
Now, we are again in a period where we move away from hereditary rule and militarism.

However, as a people, our knowledge is very closed.
We only look at the Western tradition, not from anywhere else.
Then, when we look at the Western philosophical tradition, we cherry pick the parts that seem to apply to our beliefs now.

This is Karl Jaspers's mistake.
He's only tracing one strand of the Western tradition and throwing away everything else that doesn't support his idea.

Now that we've accepted this, we can read these Chinese texts with a new mind.
We will see what we agree with and what we don't.
It'll be exciting!

Confucius:

* Rough contemporary of Socrates
* All humans have the potential to be better
