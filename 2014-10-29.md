ER 18 Notes

### October 29

Xunzi thinks every other thinker (except Confucius) is too fixated on one idea.
They limit themselves.
He also believes they think of nature as a normalizing force.

For instance, the Mohists believe in a system of rewards and punishments, backed up by ghosts and spirits in heaven.
Xunzi says, basically, they think nature is inherently good, so if we do good things, we'll get rewarded.
However, what if nature isn't good?
Following nature can be dangerous.

So Xunzi believes you should promote people who work hard at things, who don't leave it to nature.
If you are good at something, you may not work hard at it, and so not become as good.
The people who are really good at something are those who work hard, and they are the ones that should be promoted.
They use ritual to help them improve!
