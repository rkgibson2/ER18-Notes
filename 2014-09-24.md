Unlike Confucius, Mozi wants to be super rational.
*The Analects* are pretty confusing.
They just have Confucius's words and no explanation.
Mozi explains and backs up all his ideas with evidence and definitions.

Remember, this is what Mozi wants us to do: Look at things rationally.
However, Mozi knows that people may not actually look at things rationally, so what we should do is set up laws that force people to do the "rational" thing, so they will because of rewards and punishments.

Mozi says you should always listen to people above you because that is rational.
But how do you know that the person above you is rational?
Because his superior is also rational (a "proof by induction").
But what about the top person.
That's where the idea of ghosts and spirits comes in.
Mozi asks you to believe that there are ghosts and spirits in heaven that must support the top guy, so everyone down should support as well.

So, it's not totally rational.
You have to believe in these ghosts and spirits, and basically, do what you're told.
In other words, Mozi wants to convince people that the world is rational and clear cut, even when it isn't.
