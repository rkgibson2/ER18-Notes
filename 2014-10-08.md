"The Way" is the translation of the word "Dao".
Laozi (Daodejing) and others all write about the Way, leading to the school of Daoism.

One of the concepts here is Yin and Yang.
These refer to different modalities in the world.
And they are related to Qi, the vital energy that underlies the world.

Yang was associated with power and strength in a active sense.
Yin was associated with stillness and calmness.
You want a bit of both, although back then, Yang was considered better.

However, when Laozi came along, he argued that Yin was better, should be favored over Yang.
Passivity and "weakness" is better.
It would get you closer to the way.
