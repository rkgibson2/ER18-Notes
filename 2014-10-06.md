#### Laozi and the Dao De Jing

Laozi is very confusing.
We don't know much about him, and the Dao De Jing is very confusing as well.
People see lots of different things in the book (philosophical, military, martial arts)

Some people think it was written by a bunch of people and isn't coherent, but Professor Puett thinks it is coherent.
Even if it was written by multiple people, it still has a coherent message.

The Way (The Dao) is everything in it's pure, true state.
For example, grass.
It starts out as a seed, growing, but as it grows, it changes.
Thus, it comes from the way.
After it dies, it returns to purity, returning to the way.

We can't talk about the Way because it is everything.
As soon as we start talking about it, we are differentiating it from everything in the world, so it is no longer the Way.

Weakness is often strength.
Consider a large oak tree and a small sapling.
In a storm, the sapling can bend and not break, while the large tree gets torn down.
There's a simlar situation with rock and water.
Even though rock is strong, water will go around anything.

If you try to stand up to everything, you'll eventually reach something you can't stand up to, and get broken.
"Weak" things will always shift and evolve.

Many different disciplines take things from this.
Most Asian martial arts like it.
You want to adapt to the other person's strength, use it against them.
Let them destroy themselves.
