We have many preconceptions of Confucius.
Let's examine them.

* "Conficius says we should slavishly follow rituals.
He is a huge conservative."

    He is actually the opposite.
    We want to notive and use rituals to train ourselves and change.

By examining these rituals and becoming more sensitive, etc. you start breaking out of these routines.
You gain a sensibility, an ability to sense those around you.

You can also start changing your routines, transforming yourself, gaining, according to Confucius, *goodness*.
To Confucius, sensing people around you, examining and transforming yourself, is ethical.
You can only truly see what's going on if you are sensitive to yourself and your surroundings.

Confucian Terms:

* **Gentleman**:
This is a very misleading term.
It comes from Britain in the nineteenth century, when people wanted to be a "true gentleman."
To hime, gentlemen are people who have started on the path to improving themselves.

* **sage**:
Someone who has devoted their life to follow this process daily, the process of identifying rituals and sensing those around you and inspiring them, and knowing about yourself.

Confucius has no idea about what happens after death.
He says we should just live as well as we can while we are alive.

Confucian beliefs, trying to sense other people, lead to the idea of treating other people as equals.
And, as we pass down good rituals, society slowly becomes better and better.
