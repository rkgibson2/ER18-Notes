ER 18 Notes

### November 19, 2014

From before, Han Feizi and the other Legalist scholars were the first to actually have rulers listen to them.
Unfortunately, their ideas didn't totally help the Qin dynasty stay strong.

The new Han leader first off calls himself an Emperor (as opposed to going back to King).
He also tries to establish a similar bureaucratic structire to that of the Qin dynasty for the half of his empire closest to his capital.
The other half he gives to his generals and family to run, similar to the old Zhou kings.
However, this half and half approach doesn't work.
The generals and family who run parts of his empire don't like that they've been sent away from the capital, so they start revolting.

Everyone thinks that the Han dynasty will never survive with this half and half idea.
For a while, Emperors keep arising and dieing, without really changing anything.
The dynasty is still struggling, but there is no one else who is there to take power, so it kind of keeps stumbling on.

Eventually, an Emperor Wu comes to the throne.
He's pretty young, so no one thinks he'll accomplish much.
He asks a whole bunch of scholars what they think he should do.

Some Legalists show up.
They say that the Qin were right, but Qin Shihuang didn't follow them well enough.
He wasn't empty enough, as Han Feizi says.
He was too active and allowed Li Si to control him too much.

However, the Confucian scholars say this will never work.
They say that if you follow Legalist ideas, the people who reach the top are the ones who are good manipulators.
Because you have all these backstabbers and manipulators at the top, what happened to the Qin will always happen in a Legalist world.

In the end, Emperor Wu tries to follow the Qin/Legalist ideas.
He launches wars to attack the other areas that are led by the generals and family members, conquering them.
He then continues attacking in all directions, invading South Asia and Central Asia.
And, instead of burning books and killing Confucian scholars, he gives a few of them some minister positions, but this is mostly just an act.
He doesn't really want to follow Confucian ideals.

The invasion of Central Asia is very bad for the Han.
There isn't much agriculture in the steppes.
Instead, they are mostly horseman, and when the Han invade, they just retreat, and raid the supply lines and eventually harry the armies to death.
Emperor Wu, however, keeps sending out new armies, and they keep dieing.
This causes the state to do really bad, and the Han dynasty looks ready to collapse like the Qin.

The new rulers now ask the Confucian scholars at court what they'd do.
They respond that the state should get rid of the huge armies, but keep the buereaucracy and meritocracy.
Then, to avoid the Legalist problem where all the backstabbers end up at the top, the "merit" in the meritocracy should be based around Confucian self-cultivation.
The Confucians also accept that people are messy, so they think that laws can be contradictory, and people have to interpret them.
The judges have to look at the laws and interpret how they should apply.
