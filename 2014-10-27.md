ER 18 Notes
===========

### October 27, 2014

This week, we are talking about [Xunzi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xunzi).
He lived later than everyone else that we've talked about, so he has read what everyone else has said.
He mostly agrees with Confucius, but thinks others had some good things as well, so he synthesized ideas from everyone.
He says all the other thinkers each miss the mark in some way.

For instance, Mengzi says that, to encourage good behavior, we should use a system of rewards and punishments.
However, Xunzi says that strategy, while it might work, would end up emphasizing bad areas of humanity.
