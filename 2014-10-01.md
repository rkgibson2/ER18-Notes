Imagine you see a child on the edge of a well, about to fall in.
What do you do?
Immediately go to save them!

This means that we all have basic inclinations towards goodness native inside us.
If we all start from here, these sprouts of goodness inside us, we can all grow to become better.
So life is creating the proper soil to nourish these sprouts, watering them, and constantly cultivating them (weeding, etc.).

But Mengzi says we are actually killing the sprouts!
By not nourishing them, or by following the hard, exact Mohist ideas of goodness.
When goodness comes from external guidelines, then to you, it is always an abstract thing, not something personal.

Of course, Mozi disagrees with Mengzi here.
He says that people need guidelines, or they'll never get to the right end.

Mozi likes "impartial caring"
Mengzi says that idea doesn't work.
If you look at everyoe the same, then you don't care for anyone.
You can't cultivate a sensibility in yourself, and you end up not caring for anyone.

A lot of kings don't like Mencius.
This is because one of his main ideas is that only good kings will survive.
Bad kings will and should get overthrown by their people.
This is troublesome to the kings.
