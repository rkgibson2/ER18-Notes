### September 8, 2014

The world has always been interconnected.
The speed was just slower a long time ago.

#### Bronze Age
Humans farmet for a long time, then discovered bronze somewhere in Western Asia.
This discovery spread quickly across Eurasia.

Increased farming and the need to create bronze tools (miners, smiths, etc.) caused society to become stratified
This is especially true because bronze was expensive, so only some farmers/people could use it.
People were put into heriditary social classes.

---
Lots of philosophical thought comes from when society breaks down.

#### Iron Age
People discover iron, which is stronger and cheaper than bronze.
Iron is much easier to mass produce, so all people can use iron tools.
People could also now create mass-produced iron weapons.
This combined with population growth caused armies to grow.

Strong army leaders were promoted, causing some succeess to be based on merit, not birth.
Also, cities and trade grow, causing merchants to gain power.

Class based on birth started to break down; social mobility increased.
New types of rule are developed, often merit based (Confucius and confucian exams).

Along with this new mobility, new religions are founded, Jainism, Buddhism, etc.

** Chinese political ideas before Bronze Age

Kings rule because they are moral.
When they get old, they look for the most moral person around and give the throne to them.
In other words, this isn't hereditary rule.

** At beginning of Bronze Age (Three Dynasties)**

One guy became king because he was moral.
However, he passed on the throne to his son, not some other moral guy, and so on and so on.

This was known as the period of the Three Dynasties.

Chinese believed in the idea of ***Mandate of Heaven*** to claim that there will always be a good ruler on the throne even in a dynasty.
A deity, Heavan, will grant the mandate to someone, who can pass rule on to his sons.
However, if the ruler is ever not moral, Heaven will cause the old dynasty to fall and a new dynasty, led by the most moral person.

**First Dynasties**

* All start off strong, but eventually become not moral and fall from power.*

1. Xia
1. Shang
1. Zhou

However, the Zhou decline during beginning of the Iron Age.
There is no other aristocratic family to take power from the Zhou because the appearance of iron tools and weapons cause all the aristocratic families to decline.

China splits up into many small states.
The rulers realize that the states will only survive if they can win the support of the populace.
This causes them to create laws, public infrastructure, bureaucracy, meritocracy, etc.

All these states compete with each other to be the best, the most effective.
All states need smart people to run bureaucraces, so they start lots of schools to train future bureaucrats.
People are taught to read, argue, think, lead, analyze, and they all want a bureaucratic position.

** A new class has emerged **

A class of highly educated, ambitious scholars who want high positions.
This leads to the emergence of philosophers as these educated people argue about everything.
The ones who like the states say why they like  them.
The unsatisfied ones try to create new ideas in their own image, and everyone argues.

Chinese philosophers focus much more on social constructs and the social world.
They don't deal with very abstract questions like western philosophers (Why do we exist?, How can we know things are real?).
