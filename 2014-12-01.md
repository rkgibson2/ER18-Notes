#### Review

When we look at the world, we look at the past as something that we are changing.
We think that the past was one way, and then, in the nineteenth century (or a little earlier), we started breaking from that.
We started creating a new modern world, mostly led by Europe and the "West."

Unfortunately, that idea is wrong.
All these ideas, globalization, free markets, etc. were actually developing elsewhere in the world much before the nineteenth century.
Then, there were some wars between the different ideas for how to organize the world (communism, fascism, etc.) but by now, we've mostly solved all of these problems.
All the big ideas have been solved, and there's not much less to do.

As may be expected, this is probably not true.
Many of the ways we see the world are just possible visions, not the correct one.
No single view can be accurate all of the time.
Also, we think of ourselves as rational human beings, but we aren't.
And then although we think we've solved all the big problems, they are still there.
We say that we've solved the big problems, so the little things should just fall into place, but what if our base assumptions are incorrect, and **THAT** is why we can't solve these problems (poverty, climate change).

We need to learn from all cultures, both spacially and temporally.
Learn what is good from each and what's bad, and use them all.
