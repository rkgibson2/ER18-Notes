## [Lord Shang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang_Yang)

(Shang Yang, Gong-sun Yang)

He cares about how to build an effective state.
He claims that most of the other philosophers say things that are dangerous.
However, many of his ideas are still seen today.

Lord Shange lived in the state of Qin, which, because of his actions, became very important in Chinese history.
He thought most other philosohpers were wrong.
And, more importantly, he was able to put his ideas into practice.
He was the chief minister of Qin, so his reforms were real.
They lasted for almost a century, until the state of Qin became the Qin dynasty and then quickly fell.

Lord Shang is very direct.
He says that asking whether people should cultivate themselves (Confucius, Mozi, Xunzi) is not only wrong, but dangerous.
If people start cultivating themselves, then you as a ruler can't control them.
Also, then the state would have to have cultivated people, good people, to run it, and he wants a strong, effective state that is independent of whoever is running it.
He wants a society based off of laws and standards, not actual people.
If these laws are effective (lead to a strong state), then your dynasty can last for generations because it proceeds with the same laws.

For instance, he lived during the Warring States period, so each state was concerned with war.
You need some way to assure that you grow enough food to feed your army.
Lord Shang says the state should figure out exactly how much food can be grown in each area and so figure out how to allocate people to farm or fight.
The state should have statistical offices and all that to figure it out.

If you figure out exactly how much extra food you can have, you can train a bigger army than anyone else.
Then, you can invade nearby states, conquer them, and incorporate them into your state/army, so you can continue conquering.

Lord Shang wants people to do what they are told (good for a ruler).
His idea is that every punishment should be really, really severe, no matter the offense.
Then people will always follow the rules because the punishments are so bad.
Over time, people will get used to this and just do what they are told without the punishments.
