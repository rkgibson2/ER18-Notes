Second sage of Chinese pholosophy: [Mengzi (Mencius)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mencius)

Mengzi lived during the 4th century BC.
At this time, there were many de facto independent states, each preparing for war to destroy the other states.
Also, the Mohists have become very influential, which is bad for Confucians, and not many rulers agree with Confucian beliefs.

Mengzi is Confucian.
He believes that Confucius was the last great sage.
However, he thinks that Confucius' ideas are too complicated.
Mengzi wants to simplify and clarify.
He wants to better define terms like gooodness, and concretely say what makes a good Confucian.
This is partiall because he is scared of the rise of Mohism, which is very clear.

Mengzi thinks that Mohist ideas about using rewards and punishments to force people to help society will actually cause people to act in their own self-intrest.
He thinks that the rewards and punishments will influence people, but not towards helping society and other people.
They will just start doing things that benefit themself.
This, to him, is scary because it will cause people to unconsciously behave in selfish ways.

So Mengzi wants to clarify Confucian beliefs, but at the same time, he doesn't want to make it too simple.
He wants it to be understandable, as long as people try a bit to understand.

He uses human psychology.
He tries to explain how you will feel if you do the right thing, so you have a small guide along the cultivation process.

Think of human nature like a plant.
We all have sprouts of goodness, but we then need to tend to them: constant work.
We need to avoid weeds, water the plant, keep it in sunlight, and if we do all these, then it naturally grows into a mature plant.
We are like this; we can all grouw into a sage.
