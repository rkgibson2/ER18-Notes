Zhou dynasty is failing.
The king/emperor is still on the throne, but he doesn't have much power.
Fiefdoms/smaller kingdoms are each trying to become more powerful.
They each try to attract smart competent leaders to help their governments.

Confucius is one of these administrators, but, because his ideas are a little weird, he isn't too successful politically.
Once he retires, he becomes a teacher and continues to develop his ideas.
After his death, his disciples write down what he says, forming the *[Analects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analects)*.

Parts of the *Analects*, especially Book 10, are very "boring".
They talk about the details of Confucius's daily life, not really philosophy.
However, they are important!

**Every day, we follow rituals and conventions in our lives, so Confucius says we should start our examination there when we want to better ourselves.**

Then, because we spend so much time following these conventions, we should examine them and figure out what's good and what's bad.
By recognizing it, we can slowly work towards changing it.

Through small rituals, we can teach larger attitudes towards life.
For example, we force children to say "Please" and "Thank you", and that instills general politeness in them.
This is the Confucian ideal.

If I act carefully, I will be be more sensitive, towards myself and others.
This is what Confucius calls *goodness*.
Furthermore, by noticing our daily rituals and trying to change them, we gain a better sense of sensitivity, which leads to a better sense of goodness.
