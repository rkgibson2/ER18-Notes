#### Review

**[Confucius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius)**:

* We believe that we should find our true inner self and follow it.
However, that doesn't really work.
We end up subconciously falling into patterns and then just following those patterns forever for no real meaning.

* We should focus on ritual.
By focusing on these things, we break out of the subconcious patterns we've fallen into.
Instead, we actually start gaining sensitivity towards whatever the ritual helps us with (learning how to be grateful by saying please and thank you).

* Following these rituals for a while will give you a sensibility towards goodness (both of which are pretty ill-defined concenpts).
Goodness is mostly an inner thing, whose definition changes based on who Confucius is talking to.
There are no easy answers.

* If you do this for your whole life, you eventually gain the ability to tell which rituals are good and bad.

**[Mozi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozi)**

* Mozi was one of Confucius's fiercest critics.

* He didn't like how vague Confucius was.
He thought that people should have a clear definition of what goodness is and how to achieve it.

* **Goodness** is what is best for the most number of people possible.
This is called **impartial caring**.
Thus, rituals that don't help people are bad (musical performances, elaborate funeral rituals).

* Mozi also realizes that people don't act this way on their own, so he creates a social structure that convinces people to act this way.
Society is ruled by spirit "**Heaven**" and a bunch of ghosts.
They reward you if you are good (in a Mozi sense) and punish you if you are bad.

* Society is then organized in the same way.
There are lots of laws for what is good and bad, and, eventually, people will internalize these, and end up acting "rationally."

**[Mencius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mencius)**

* Mencius is an early critic of Mozi.
He says that people wouldn't actually act rationally like that to help people.
However, Mozi's ideas would still have effect, but for different reasons.
They would be effective because you train them to get rewards and avoid punishments, and they'd end up acting like that, not with impartial caring.

* We should have no external standards, says Mencius.
He thinks that we are innately good (everyone would rush to save a child from falling into a well).
However, we don't really show this that much.
We are really like sprouts.
We have an innate potential for goodness and, with cultivation, can become good (the Confucian definiion), but it doesn't necessarily come to pass.
Thus, we don't need external standards or definitions.
We should, instead, self-cultivate to improve the goodness inside ourselves.

**[Laozi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi)**

* **The Way**: That from which everything comes and that to which everything returns.

* You should think of everything as similar and undifferentiated and interconnected.
The more you see things as differentiated, the farther you've gone from the way.

* The strongest isn't always the best or the winner.
Strength lies in weakness.

**Inward Training**

* Internal energy **qi** is important.
Everything consists of these energies, even inanimate objects, but different objects have different levels of refinement.

* Alive objects have *essence*, a medium level of refinement. Some objects have *luminosity*, an energy so refined that they can affect the world (humans, angels).

* Thus, we want to cultivate ourselves to raise our level of refinement and qi.
(Somewhat like Laozi, but more concrete.)

**[Zhuangzi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuang_Zhou)**

* Zhuangzi has a different view of the way.
He sees the way as **everything** in a constant state of flux.

* Humans are the one part of nature to fight against they way.
We have minds, which are great, but we misue them.
We create too many rigid distinctions and stable definitions.
Thus, we constantly fight against the way and constantly lose.

* We should tear down these distinctions and be more **spontaneous** (instinctual).
You train yourself to sense situations and sense the way to figure out what action is spontaneous.

**[Xunzi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xunzi)**

* Xunzi mostly agrees with Zhuangzi, but for a few things.
He doesn't like how Zhuangzi wnats us to transcend the human and just go with the Way and become part of the larger world.
He thinks that if this happens, the world will be too messy, too hard to follow.

* Xunzi says all the previous philosophers fall short because they become too fixated on one thing.

* We need to follow ritual to change ourselves and, hopefully, create a moral world.

**[Lord Shang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang_Yang)

* **Legalist** philosohper

* Morality, self-cultivation, and all that aren't important.
We want a strong state, ruled by strong laws and strong institutions.

**[Han Feizi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Fei)**

* You also need a few people to run this system, to choose what laws are good and bad, to create new laws.
Also, the people who make it to the top are likely to be cunning and dangerous, so how do you handle that.

* His major idea comes from Laozi.
The ruler should be empty, quiet, still, so the ministers don't know what he wants and will work towards the good of the state.
If the ruler is stupid, he will actually be empty, and the minsters can run things from behind the scene.

**[Qin dynasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_dynasty)**

* Following the Legalist ideas, Qin Shihuang and Li Si created the Qin dynasty.
However, as may have been predicted by Han Feizi, they didn't do well and eventually the dynasty fell.

**[Han Dynasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty)**

* Eventually, the rulers asked Confucian scholars what they thought.
They agreed with the Legalist ideas on strong institutions, but thought that those at the top should be moral and cultivated.
Instead of being cunning politicians, they should have cultivated their sprout (Mencius).
