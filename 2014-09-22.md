[Mozi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozi) (followers are Mohists) is a disciple of Confucius, but he believes some of Confucius's ideas are wrong.
His ideas are more similar to our western ideas today.

Mozi, like Confucius, believes the world isn't good.
He thinks that people should try to become more ethical human beings.
However, unlike Confucius, he thinks that we should follow our rational mind, and then everything will work out.
We don't need to slowly follow rituals and become sensitive to others, etc.
Just be rational.

Confucius doesn't like to define goodness because he thinks it's kind of nebulous in general.
It's different for each person.
Mozi thinks that goodness and ethics need to be defined for people to follow it.

**Good** is what benefits the most people possible.
If you act in a way that benefits others, then you are being moral.
(Kind of like [Utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism)??)

So on the subject of rituals:

* Confucius thinks music is super important.
Mozi thinks that it takes too long to learn how to make music and practice and is too expensive, so he doesn't like them.

* Confucius thinks mourning rituals are important.
Mozi thinks they are expensive and take time away from work, so mourn for a really short time, but then get back to work.

Mozi believes that we should view everyone identically and treat everyone identically, give everyone universal care, because that is the best for everyone.
Following this line of thought, warfare shouldn't exist.
It comes when people disagree about what is best for their state versus some other state, but all states should be equal.
(Now sounds kind of like [Communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism))

Now, we need to build a society that encourages people to act in this way.
So, we need a society with laws that treat everyone equally.
Then, set up a system that rewards people who act "morally" and punish those who don't.
These rewards and punishments don't take into account circumstances, thoughts, etc.; just what is done.
People want to be rewarded, so over time, they start to be "moral".

**Behavior, not intent, is important.**

Furthermore, he argues that all the other worlds are also moral, so even in states without such laws, people are "moral.
He has a deity, Heaven, who created the world and wants people to do good.
Heaven doesn't really interact, but there are also a bunch of ghosts and spirits who watch how we act and reward, in their own way, people are moral.
So even in a state without these laws, the ghosts and spirits provide a reason to act morally.

Mohists created a militia that would defend any state that was attacked.
They tried to convince rulers that attacking anyone would be bad, because the Mohists would join the other side.
In fact, if they were defending a country, and the other country retreated, and the first country pursued, the Mohists would switch sides, defending the country now being attacked.

Mozi is very extreme, but some of his ideas still have merits today.
We also believe that laws should be classblind, should apply to everyone equally.
His ideas mostly sound extreme because he takes his ideas and pushes them as far as they go.
Michael Puett says we are probably "watered-down Mohists".
Their ideas start out ok, but are maybe taken a little too far.
