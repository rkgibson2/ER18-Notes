#### The Rise of the Qin

The Qin follow the ideas of Lord Shang and Han Feizi and form a strong infantry army.
Eventually, the minister Li Si took most of the power, and, together with King Zheng (would become Qin Shihuang), put into practice the ideas of Lord Shang and Han Feizi.
Together, they start attacking the surrounding states.

They are very strong, so they conquer many states.
Many of them join forces to try to stand up to the Qin juggernaut, but it is ineffective.
The Qin eventually conquer all the states of China, bringing them under one ruler.

Unlike the previous dynasties, the ruler of Qin don't say anything about the Mandate of Heaven.
They say it is specifically because Qin is strong, has strong rulers, strong laws, and a strong army.
They say it is because they can destroy all the other states.
Because of this, they will never lose the Mandate of Heaven, so they will ruler forever.
No other dynasty will ever rise to replace them; Qin will just go on.
To further differentiate themselves from the previous dynasties, they decide that they will now be Emperors (August God in Chinese, but translated as Emperor).

Furthermore, Qin Shihuang declares that this is the beginning of a new era.
And, following the Legalist ideas, he burns all the books that aren't directly important to the state (military, agriculture, etc.).
Specifically, he burns all the books of the previous scholars and kills all the people who follow their ideas.
He tries to eradicate the past, and wipe out anyone who talks about the past.

He also tries to regulate everything, coinage, characters, weights and measures, etc.
This makes everything the same, and the best to serve the state.
He also starts building a bunch of public works projects to serve the state (roads, Great Wall), as well as lots of monuments to himself (Terracotta Warriors, his tomb).

However, Han Feizi notes that the relationship between ruler and minister is important and dangerous.
This is true for the relationship between Qin Shihuang and Li Si.
And, furthermore, unlike Han Feizi advises, Qin Shihuang isn't very "empty" or "still."
Instead, Li Si does exactly what Han Feizi fears, and plays into Qin Shihuang's desires.
Also, the people don't believe that they are living in a casual state with some good laws.
They know that they are living in a military dictatorship.

However, here we run into a problem.
Qin Shihuang definitely wants to have his son inherit the throne after him.
However, Li Si looks at the son and sees someone very dangerous.
The son's friendly ministers and the son don't like Li Si.
When Qin Shihuang dies, Li Si forges a document saying that a different, slightly dumb son should have the succession.
This son ends up succeeding to the throne,
When the son is on the throne, the other ministers look at Li Si and don't like him, so they start trying to undermine him.
The other ministers start talking to the new emperor and telling him that Li Si is bad.
He believes them, and eventually declares Li Si a traitor.
Li Si ends up being tortured to death.

Then, the other minsters start fighting amongst themselves and all the problems of the Qin empire surface again.
Revolts start breaking out and eventually, the empire falls and the Han Dynasty starts, which lasts for four centuries.
