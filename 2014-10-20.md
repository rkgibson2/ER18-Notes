**[Zhuangzi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuang_Zhou)**

He is classified as a Daoist, but he wouldn't have considered himself similar to Laozi.
He's classified this way because he talks about The Way (The Dao) a lot.

For Zhuangzi, the Way means everything in constant flux and transition.
Grass growing, the seasons, all are "The Way".
Furthermore, these things happen without thinking, they just happen.
Birds don't think about flying, seasons don't think about changing.
These changes happen because of spontaneous interaction between Yin and Yang.

**Except for one thing!!**

We are different.
Human beings uniquely are not spontaneous.
We are a part of The Way, but we battle against it.
This dichotomy arises because of our minds.
Zhuangzi says the mind is good, but we misuse it, like a bird using its wings to swim (penguins??, lol jk).
We use the mind to create false categories and stable (that's bad) things.
However, this causes us to drop out of the constant change happening around us, so we battle against the changing way and fail.

It seems like the solution to this is just do spontaneous things occasionally (like randomly dance on the podium).
Zuangzi says this isn't really spontaneous though.
However, when we do these "spontaneous" things, they are really just things we want to do subconciously, but it isn't really spontaneous.
So the question is: "How do you become spontaneous?"

We are supposed to relax, and just go with the flow.
Remember the story about the piano player.
After playing for a long time, you eventually just know how to play, how to read the room.
Eventually, you just play, and know which notes to play, how loud, how fast, your playing just spontaneously happens.
That is the way.
