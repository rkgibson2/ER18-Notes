ER 18 Notes

This week, we are learning about [Han Feizi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Fei).
He is a legalist philosopher, like Lord Shang, who believes in the power of law.
He is possibly the most influential political thinker in Chinese history.

Han Feizi was a student of Xunzi.
However, he looked at Xunzi's belief in self-cultivation and didn't like it.
If people cultivate themselves, then you (and rulers) won't know what people will look like in the future.
People will do what they want to do, improve in ways they want to improve; people are uncontrollable.
And if people are uncontrollable, then it is hard to maintain order.

Han Feizi says there should be one person, the ruler, who knows that people create the world and improve it, but everyone else should just live in the world.
